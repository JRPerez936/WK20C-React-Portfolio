# WK20C-React-Portfolio

## Description
  This repo contains code for a "React Portfolio". On my own, I was tasked with 
  designing an portfolio that utilizes React elements to create webpage that has
  information about me and the programming I have worked on.
  
  With react, I was able to create a fully functional portfolio that fit the
  criteria. A link to the website can be found here
